Imagine you are going for hiking and your goal is to reach the highest peak possible. 
You already have the map before you start, but there are thousands of possible paths shown on the map. 
You are too lazy and simply don’t have the time to evaluate each of them. Screw the map! 
You started hiking with a simple strategy – be greedy and short-sighted. Just take paths that slope upwards the most.

After the trip ended and your whole body is sore and tired, you look at the hiking map for the first time. Oh my god! 
There’s a muddy river that I should’ve crossed, instead of keep walking upwards.

A greedy algorithm picks the best immediate choice and never reconsiders its choices.
