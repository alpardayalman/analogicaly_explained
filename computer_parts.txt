If Computers were Cars:

##Data / Gas: 
Your car can't do anything without gas, in my example, data is like gas in a car. 
You fill the car up with gas so that you can do something useful (take a trip).

##CPU / Motor: 
Your processor is like the motor of your car, it will determine the overall horsepower you have.

##Hard Drive / Gas Tank :
This is your gas tank of data, it determines how much information you can hold in the computer, 
while not all of it is used at one time. Of course, unlike gas, this data doesn't go away when it is used by the motor.

##RAM / Carburetor: 
Think of memory like your carburetor. Data is pulled from your hard drive and held temporarily in RAM for immediate consumption by the motor. 
Adding RAM allows the CPU access to more gas at one time, increasing its sped potential. 
8gb RAM to 16gb RAM is akin to upgrading from a 2-barrel to a 4-barrel carb.
